<h3>2- Movie</h3>

<h3>Movie: The Sequel</h3>

<p>"Movie: The Sequel" is a drama, comedy, horror, documentary, fantasy movie, that somehow is able to be even better than the first one. Critically acclaimed by everyone, the movie is engaging and capable of making even the hardest watchers sob uncontrolably when facing the main character's main dilemma: why do we sometimes wake up in the middle of the night to drink 3 liters of water?</p>
